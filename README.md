## Prerequisites

- node stable version [24.6.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v24.6.0/)
- [Yarn 4.9.2](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager (see installation instructions below)
- TypeScript 5.8.3

### Installing Yarn

This project uses Yarn 4.9.2 managed by corepack (built into Node.js 16.10+). To ensure all team members use the same version, follow these installation steps:

1. **Enable corepack (if not already enabled):**

   ```shell
   corepack enable
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```shell
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Verify the installation:**

   ```shell
   yarn --version
   # Should output: 4.9.2
   ```

**To Note:** 
- Corepack automatically uses the Yarn version specified in the `packageManager` field of `package.json`. No additional setup is required once corepack is enabled
- Corepack is the preferred `yarn` way, to install the package manager, instead of `npm install -g yarn` in your ci/cd pipeline
- `yarn install --immutable` ensures that the lockfile (`yarn.lock`) is not modified during the installation process

## Getting started

### Set local environment variables

Create your local config file `.env` from the template file:

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

### Align to the Node Version specified for this project

If using Node Version Manager (nvm), use the following command to switch to the correct version:

```shell
nvm use
nvm install
```

### Install dependencies and run application for development

```shell
yarn install
yarn build
yarn dev
```

Then, load http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to access the app.

### Install dependencies and run application for production
```shell
yarn install
yarn build
yarn start
```

#### Node Version Manager

You may have to tell your local machine to use the latest version of node already installed on your device, before installing and running the application. Use the following command.

```shell
nvm install node
```

#### Running locally with docker

Prerequisites, Docker Desktop

- To build the docker image

  ```shell
  docker build -t mcc:latest .
  ```

- To run the docker image

  ```shell
  docker run -d -p 8888:3000 mcc:latest
  ```
  (The application should be running at http://localhost:8888)

- To stop the container

  obtain the container id
  ```shell
  docker ps
  ```
  stop the container
  ```shell
  docker stop {container_id}
  ```

## Routing
This template uses the built-in Express JS routing. 

A route is a section of Express code that associates an HTTP verb (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.), with a URL path/pattern, and a function that is called to handle that pattern.

[You can find further documentation here](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html).

## Testing
There are many frameworks to test your Express.js application (a few of these frameworks will be signposted below), but you will want to split out your test suite to cover:

- Unit Tests - test individual code components to ensure each function operates as intended.
- Integration Tests - assess the coherence of the entire application, ensuring smooth interactions between various parts.
- End-to-end (E2E) Tests - assess the entire software system, from the user interface to the database.

### Running All Tests

To run both unit and end-to-end tests with a single command:

```shell
yarn test
```

This command will first run the unit tests with Mocha and then run the end-to-end tests with Playwright.

### Unit/Integration Testing frameworks
- We use [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as our unit testing framework. It is a widely-used JavaScript testing framework that works well with TypeScript projects and integrates with CI pipelines.
- We also use [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) to help with our test assertions, in mocha.
- Unit tests run from the `tests/unit/` directory
- Run unit tests with `yarn test:unit`

**To set-up locally**
- Install all the dependencies:
```shell
yarn install
```

- run unit test's:
```shell
yarn test:unit
```

### E2E Testing with Playwright
This project uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end testing. Playwright provides reliable end-to-end testing for modern web apps.

- E2E tests run from the `tests/e2e/` directory
- Run E2E tests with `yarn test:e2e`

#### Running Tests Locally

To run the E2E tests locally:

```shell
# Run all tests
yarn test:e2e

# Run specific test file
yarn playwright test tests/e2e/specific-test.spec.ts

# Run in UI mode with Playwright Test Explorer
yarn playwright test --ui
```

#### Configuration

The project uses Chromium for testing to ensure consistency with our production environment. The configuration can be found in `playwright.config.ts`.

Key configuration points:
- Tests are located in `tests/e2e/` directory
- Only Chromium browser is used for testing
- Test retries are enabled in CI environments (2 retries)
- Traces are automatically captured on test failures for debugging

#### CI/CD Integration

The tests are automatically run in our GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/playwright.yml`) during pull requests and deployments to UAT.

- The workflow installs only the Chromium browser to optimize CI runtime
- Traces are captured for all test runs in CI for easier debugging
- Test artifacts (traces, videos) are preserved for 14 days in GitHub Actions

#### Debugging Failed Tests

When tests fail in CI:
1. Check the error message in the GitHub Actions log
2. Download the trace artifacts (named `playwright-traces.zip`) from GitHub Actions
3. Extract the downloaded ZIP file - inside you'll find folders organized by test name
4. Locate the `trace.zip` file within the specific test folder you want to debug
5. Open traces using one of the following methods:

   **With local Trace Viewer:**
   ```shell
   yarn playwright show-trace path/to/extracted/test-folder/trace.zip
   ```

   **With online Trace Viewer:**
   Upload the trace.zip file to https://trace.playwright.dev/ - this allows sharing traces with team members without requiring local Playwright installation

This provides a timeline view of the test execution with screenshots, DOM snapshots, and network requests to help diagnose issues.

#### Route Coverage Analysis
The `scripts/e2e_coverage/route-coverage-analysis.sh` script analyses which Express routes have corresponding E2E tests, helping ensure comprehensive test coverage.

```shell
# Run the route coverage analysis
./scripts/e2e_coverage/route-coverage-analysis.sh
```

The script:
- Extracts all registered Express routes from the application
- Runs E2E tests with debug logging to capture visited routes
- Compares the two lists and reports coverage percentage
- Shows which routes are missing E2E tests

Use this to identify gaps in your E2E test coverage and ensure all user-facing routes are properly tested.

### Accessibility Testing

This project includes automated accessibility testing using [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) integrated with Playwright to ensure WCAG 2.2 AA compliance.

#### How Accessibility Tests Work

- Accessibility tests run automatically as part of the CI pipeline in a separate parallel job
- Tests scan each page for WCAG violations using axe-core rules: `wcag2a`, `wcag2aa`, `wcag21a`, `wcag21aa`, `wcag22aa`
- Each major page has a corresponding accessibility test (e.g., `homepage should be accessible`, `search page should be accessible`)

#### Running Accessibility Tests Locally

```shell
# Run only accessibility tests
yarn test:e2e --grep "should be accessible"

# Run all tests (functional + accessibility)
yarn test:e2e

# Run accessibility tests in UI mode for debugging
yarn playwright test --grep "should be accessible"
```

#### CI Integration

Accessibility tests run in parallel with functional E2E tests in the GitHub Actions workflow:
- **Functional Tests Job**: Runs all E2E tests except accessibility tests
- **Accessibility Tests Job**: Runs only accessibility tests (filtered by `"should be accessible"`)

Both jobs must pass for deployment to proceed.

#### Accessibility Test Reports

When accessibility tests fail in CI:

1. **Access the Report**:
   - Go to the failed CI run in GitHub Actions
   - Scroll down to the "Artifacts" section
   - Download `accessibility-report.zip`

2. **View Detailed Results**:
   - Extract the downloaded ZIP file
   - Open `playwright-report/index.html` in your browser
   - This provides an interactive report with:
     - List of all accessibility violations found
     - WCAG rule details and impact levels (serious, moderate, minor)
     - Affected DOM elements with selectors
     - Screenshots showing the violations
     - Remediation guidance

3. **Understanding Violations**:
   Each violation includes:
   - **Rule ID**: The specific WCAG rule violated (e.g., `color-contrast`, `document-title`)
   - **Impact**: Severity level (serious, moderate, minor, critical)
   - **Description**: What the rule checks for
   - **Help**: How to fix the issue
   - **Elements**: Specific HTML elements that failed the rule

#### Adding Accessibility Tests

To add accessibility testing to a new page:

```typescript
test('page name should be accessible', async ({ page, checkAccessibility }) => {
  await page.goto('/your-page-url');
  await checkAccessibility();
});
```

The `checkAccessibility` fixture is available in all test files and will automatically scan the current page for WCAG violations.

### Code coverage - unit tests
We use the library [c8](https://github.com/bcoe/c8) which output unit test coverage reports using Node.js' built in coverage.

- Devs can run this locally:
```bash
yarn coverage
```

- To open the report, after running locally:
```bash
open coverage/index.html
```

When coverage fails in CI:
1. Check the error message in the GitHub Actions log - in the `Mocha Unit Test` job
2. Download the trace artifacts (named `code-coverage-report.zip`) from GitHub Actions
3. Extract the downloaded ZIP file
4. Locate the `index.html` file within the `code-coverage-report` folder, and view in you browser

### Asset management
This project uses [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) for asset bundling and management, providing fast builds and efficient handling of JavaScript, TypeScript, and SCSS files.

### Cache busting
Caching allows Express.js applications to store and serve frequently requested data efficiently, reducing the strain on servers and minimizing latency. This template improves caching through:
- intelligent browser caching, when using the template for development of an application
- employing a package management tool, to improve the caching process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software from your application

### Form validation
This template app contains a basic demo for form validation, when running this app locally. You can find further information on the validation used, by searching in the [Express documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-validator)


### CSRF protection
The template uses the [csrf-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csrf-sync/v/1.0.2) middleware, to help keep your app secure.

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
This app uses [helmet.js](https://helmetjs.github.io/) to help secure this Express.js template app by setting HTTP response headers, which includes your CSP. 

### Response compression
The app uses a Node.js compression middleware called [compression](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compression). The middleware will attempt to compress response bodies for all request that traverse through the middleware, based on the given options.


### Rate limiting
This template uses a basic rate-limiting middleware for Express.js, called `express-rate-limit`. It is used to limit repeated requests to public APIs and/or endpoints such as password reset. 

For further information please [visit the documentation here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit?activeTab=readme).

### Linter
ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript and TypeScript code. It helps maintain code quality and consistency across a project by enforcing a set of coding standards and best practices. ESLint can catch syntax errors, stylistic issues, and potential bugs before they become actual problems.

The project has TypeScript support through the `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser` packages installed as dev dependencies.

To run ESLint:

```shell
yarn lint
```

This will run ESLint on all TypeScript files in your project, ignoring specific files and directories.

#### Ignore Configuration

The project configures ESLint to ignore certain files directly in the `eslint.config.js` file:

```javascript
{
  ignores: [
    'node_modules/*',
    'public/*',
    'tests/**/*.spec.ts'
  ],
}
```

This configuration:
- Ignores the `node_modules` directory
- Ignores the `public` directory (generated output)
- Ignores all test specification files (`*.spec.ts`) in any subdirectory of the `tests` folder

### Linter for staged commits
We use [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) & [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged) to run ESLint on all our staged git commits. This ensures that TypeScript files are linted before they're committed to the repository.

- `husky` - helps us with our Git hooks
- `lint-staged` - helps us run a linter on our staged commits (configured in package.json to target both .js and .ts files)


**To set-up locally**
- Install all the dependencies:
```shell
yarn install
```

- Initialise `husky`:
```shell
yarn husky install
```

- To help debug, run the command when you have a staged commit:
```shell
yarn lint-staged --debug
```

### TypeScript
This project uses TypeScript to provide static type checking, improving code quality and developer experience. TypeScript helps catch errors during development rather than at runtime and provides better IDE support through enhanced autocompletion and navigation.

#### Main TypeScript Configuration
The TypeScript configuration is defined in `tsconfig.json` with the following key settings:
- Target: ES2022
- Module System: NodeNext
- Strict Type Checking: Enabled
- Source Maps: Generated for debugging

#### Test TypeScript Configuration
The project uses a separate TypeScript configuration for tests in `tsconfig.test.json`, which extends the main configuration:

```json
{
  "extends": "./tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "module": "NodeNext",
    "moduleResolution": "NodeNext"
  },
  "include": ["tests/**/*.spec.ts", "routes/**/*.ts", "src/**/*.ts", "middleware/**/*.ts", "utils/**/*.ts"]
}
```

This configuration:
- Extends the main `tsconfig.json`
- Allows importing TypeScript files with extensions (`.ts`)
- Doesn't emit compiled output files when running tests
- Includes all test files (`*.spec.ts`) in all test subdirectories
- Includes source files from routes, src, middleware, and utils directories that tests may need to reference

To compile TypeScript files:
```shell
yarn build:ts
```

To run type checking without emitting files:
```shell
yarn tsc
```

### Axios
Within this template [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) with [middleware-axios](https://github.com/krutoo/middleware-axios) (used as a utility `../utils/axiosSetup.ts`, and can be extended with further middleware) is set up and ready to use out of the box.

Below is an example of implementation of how to use the Axios middleware in your TypeScript routes to make server/API calls:

```typescript
// routes/index.ts
import express, { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';
const router = express.Router();

/* GET home page. */
router.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  res.render('main/index', { title: 'Express' });
});

// Make an API call with `Axios` and `middleware-axios`
// GET users from external API
router.get('/users', async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  try {
    // Use the wrapped Axios instance attached to the request object (via middleware-axios)
    const response = await req.axiosMiddleware.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users');
    res.json(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    next(error);
  }
});

export default router;
```

### Nunjucks templating
This project uses [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) for server-side HTML templating. You can render Nunjucks templates from your TypeScript route handlers just as you would from JavaScript. Templates are located in the `views/` directory and are compatible with both JS and TS backends.

### Project structure and source directory
- Project-specific TypeScript code should go in `src/scripts/`.
- Other source TypeScript files are located in `src/`, `middleware/`, `routes/`, and `utils/`.
- Compiled JavaScript output is placed in the `public/` directory.
- Do not edit files in `public/` directly; always edit the `.ts` source files.

### Import paths and path aliases
- The project uses path aliases (see `tsconfig.json`), such as `import foo from '#utils/foo'`.
- Ensure your editor/IDE is configured to recognize these aliases for best developer experience.

### Running and debugging
- The app is started using the compiled JS in `public/` (see `yarn dev` and `yarn start`).
- If you want to run TypeScript directly (e.g., for debugging), consider using `ts-node` or a similar tool, but this is not the default workflow.

### Development workflow
The project uses ESBuild for fast compilation and bundling with watch mode for automatic rebuilds during development. The development workflow is managed through the `yarn dev` script which concurrently runs:

1. **TypeScript compilation in watch mode** - Monitors TypeScript source files for changes
2. **ESBuild bundling in watch mode** - Handles SCSS, JavaScript bundling, and asset copying
3. **Nodemon for server restarts** - Automatically restarts the Express server when compiled files change

The watch system monitors:
- TypeScript source files (`src/**/*.ts`) for compilation
- SCSS files (`src/scss/**/*.scss`) for CSS bundling
- Asset files from GOV.UK Frontend and MOJ Frontend packages
- The compiled output in the `public/` directory for server restarts

Nodemon configuration (`nodemon.json`):
```json
{
  "watch": ["public"],
  "ext": "js,json",
  "ignore": ["public/assets/"],
  "delay": "500ms"
}
```

This configuration:
- Watches the `public` directory for changes in compiled output
- Only monitors changes in `.js` and `.json` files
- Ignores the `public/assets/` directory (managed by ESBuild)
- Adds a 500ms delay before restarting to avoid excessive restarts during rapid file changes

The development workflow is started with:
```shell
yarn dev
```

This command builds the project initially and then sets up all watch processes for continuous development.

### Accessibility Testing
The project includes automated WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility testing using Playwright and Axe-core.

Run accessibility tests locally:
```shell
yarn test:accessibility
```

Accessibility tests run automatically in CI and will fail the build if violations are detected. Download the accessibility-report artifact from failed CI runs to see detailed violation reports.

### Type definitions
- Type definitions for Node, Express, and other dependencies are included as dev dependencies (see `@types/*` packages in `package.json`).
- These are required for type safety and improved autocompletion in TypeScript.
